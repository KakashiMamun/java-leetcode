/**
 * Created by xschen on 2/8/2017.
 *
 * summary:
 * Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
 * For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.
